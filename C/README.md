# Advent of Code 2025

These are my C solutions for this years AoC challenges

## Usage

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Running

Built executable is placed in the C root directory

```bash
./app <n1> <n2> <path>
```

**n1** - day number  
**n2** -part number  
**path** - relative path to input file
